    <h1>Breaking Silence: Why Sista, stanap strong matters.</h1>
    <p>By Esther Zhang, Vanuatu Highschool Student</p>
</header>

<div class="container">
    <p>“I remember my fear crawling with their touch, their faces sneering as I watch.” This heartbreaking line from <em>Sista, stanap strong!</em> unmasks the blatant violation men commit on a woman. What if I told you that this is not a solitary case, but a nightmare for many. Many women all over the world, many women in the South Pacific and many women in Vanuatu are facing the same issue over and over again…</p>

    <p><em>Sista, stanap strong!</em> is a Vanuatu women’s anthology, first published in 2021. This book compiles poetry, fiction, essays, memoirs, and songs from three generations of women from Vanuatu, carrying their sorrow and joy in their life. It’s a book that breaks the silence, gives voice to those who have been overlooked, and celebrates the brilliance, creativity, and power of Ni-Vanuatu women.</p>

</div>

    <h2>Domestic Violence</h2>
    <p>Domestic violence as we know is the physical or sexual harm inflicted by a partner or family member upon another family member. But the abuse does not always take the form of physical violence; there’s also emotional violence and coercive control. Emotional violence refers to undermining the victim's self-esteem through verbal abuse, threats, or emotional manipulation. Coercive control is threats, intimidation, or restrictions on the victim as a result of full control of their life. For example, gaslighting is one of the common techniques.</p>

    <p>These forms of violence happen much more often than you think. According to statistics from Vanuatu Women’s Centre:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>60% of women in Vanuatu experience physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime.</li>
        <li>68% have experienced emotional violence.</li>
        <li>28% have been subjected to multiple controlling behaviours.</li>
        <li>69% have experienced at least one form of coercive control.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Why is this violence so pervasive? Part of the answer lies in patriarchal kastom and cultural ideas of male leadership and female obedience, which affirm the control and punishment of women. When women speak up, they are often shamed or blamed, told they are “asking for trouble” or “breaking up the family,” which pushes them further into silence. On top of that, there aren’t enough trained workers or resources to make family protection laws effective. Without strong community support or reliable services, victims are left unprotected, and perpetrators often face no real consequences.</p>

    <h2>Cycle of Abuse</h2>
    <p>Domestic violence affects more than the women being harmed. It is not a private issue to be hidden behind closed doors but a social one that needs to be revealed and addressed. The more we talk about and raise awareness of the topic, the safer women will feel to share their experiences. It’s not only women who are affected; children are too.</p>

    <p>Children raised in households where violence is normalised often suffer deep psychological trauma, nightmares, anxiety, depression, and problems trusting others. Many struggle at school, develop low self-esteem, or become withdrawn and fearful. Some internalise the belief that violence is part of love; others see it as a way to solve conflict. For example, a boy who sees his mother being abused is 10 times more likely to abuse his female partner as an adult. A girl who grows up in a home where her father abuses her mother is more than six times as likely to be sexually abused as a girl who grows up in a non-abusive home.</p>

    <p>Poverty is one of the main causes that trap families in the vicious cycle of abuse. Studies show that financial pressures can fuel anger, frustration, and tension, increasing the risk of domestic abuse. Living in a violent environment also limits women and children's access to education, employment opportunities, and financial independence, preventing them from escaping poverty. Statistically, women who experience partner violence are 2–3 times more likely to face financial hardship. As a result, they may be forced to remain in abusive relationships because they lack resources to support themselves. Children who grow up in such environments often inherit the same hardships, facing obstacles that persist into adulthood, such as income instability, disrupted education, and long-lasting trauma.</p>

    <p>Breaking the cycle of abuse requires strong community support systems, educational opportunities, stable employment, and public investment in shelters, counseling, and legal protection. What victims need most is being heard. Books like <em>Sista, Stanap Strong!</em> are their media of communication with the outside world, enabling them to tell their story. That is why this anthology is so important to our society.</p>

    <h2>Is This Real Love?</h2>
    <p>In <em>Sista, Stanap Strong!</em>, a powerful poem by Roselyn Qwenako Tor, <em>Is This Real Love?</em> exposes the hidden violence that many Ni-Vanuatu women experience in their marriages.</p>

    <div class="poem">
“The wedding ring became a noose<br>
The wine indeed her blood<br>
Dance to slap and beatings<br>
The music her mournful wailing”
    </div>

    <p>In these few lines, Tor uses sharp contrast to show how beautiful things turn to pain and how empty promises can be. The wedding ring, a symbol of commitment, “became a noose”; the fine wine at her wedding “turned into her blood”; the joyful dance became “slap and beatings”; and the music was “the background of her wailing.” These shocking images make us question: is this real love? If it is, then it is not the kind of love I want.</p>

    <p>Tor’s poem reflects a wider reality. Marriage is often portrayed as a safe and sacred bond, but for many women, it is just a facade hiding abuse. According to UN Women (2024), almost one in three women worldwide have experienced physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner. As Merilyn Tahi, Coordinator of the Vanuatu Women’s Centre, said:</p>

    <blockquote>“There’s a high percentage of women that go through violence against women and children every day in this country, so we cannot be smiling to say that we are the happiest country in the world.”</blockquote>

    <h2>What I Remember</h2>
    <p>Telstar Jimmy’s poem <em>What I Remember</em> captures the devastating reality of sexual violence. The poet recalls her white shirt, her sandals, the warm sun — and then the sudden ambush, the hands of the men, the punches, her clothes torn and bloodied. These images echo the experiences of countless women and girls whose ordinary days are shattered by rape.</p>

    <p>In Vanuatu, the prevalence of sexual abuse on girls under 15 is among the highest in the world, with almost 30% reporting sexual abuse before the age of 15. For 28% of women, their first sexual experience was forced. These are not just alarming statistics; they represent lifelong trauma.</p>

    <p>According to research by the Vanuatu Women’s Centre (VWC), “comprehensive and integrated prevention programs involving families, schools, and communities are effective at reducing violence against women.” Education — teaching consent, creating safe reporting systems, and challenging harmful cultural norms — is the key to breaking the cycle of abuse. Communities, policymakers, and individuals must work together to ensure that no girl or woman has to relive the horror Jimmy describes.</p>

    <h2>Breaking Silence, Building Strength</h2>
    <p>From Telstar Jimmy's <em>What I Remember</em> to Roselyn Qwenako Tor's <em>Is This Real Love?</em>, <em>Sista, Stanap Strong!</em> is more than literature; it is testimony. It reminds us that somewhere in the world, people are suffering. They are not just someone’s daughter or wife; they are women with dreams, voices, and lives of their own, deserving to be seen, heard, and protected.</p>

    <p><em>Sista, Stanap Strong!</em> celebrates the creativity, courage, and strength of women who refuse to be silenced. It inspires readers to think deeper, understand the issue, and perhaps seek solutions. Remember: this violence could happen to anyone, anywhere. Silence is what allows it to keep happening.</p>
